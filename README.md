## AirDnD

I want to learn TypeScript and React-Native, so why not do both in one go?

I'm plannig on building an AirBnB style clone, but since I love board games, it will be used to locate drop-in games of Dungeons and Dragons in different cities.

I'd like to have a web-based application running React, and a mobile application on React-Native, to see how much code I can re-use between the two.

The front-end will be build using React/React-Native, Apollo, and GraphQL. The back-end will run on Node, Express, PostgreSQL, with a GraphQL server sitting on top of Postgres.
